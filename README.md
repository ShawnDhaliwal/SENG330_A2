For quick usage, download this repositories zipfile, run main.cpp using the command "g++ main.cpp -o main", then the command "./main"

The	application	code	for	this	assignment	utilizes	a	Prototype	Design	Pattern	to create	new	instances	of	objects	at	run	time	in	the	C++	language.	Serialization	of created	objects	using	Google	Protocol	Buffers	was	attempted	but	not	successful. The	assignment	successfully	implements	Googleâ€™s	Testing Framework	to	test	the	application	code.

This assignment is based	on	a	hypothetical	gym	scenario.	All	coding	was	done	using	the	Xcode	developer	tool	that	is	available	to	download	in	the	app	store	for	all	Max	OS	X	users. The	assignment	spanned	a	period	of	5	days	and	its	development	process is	posted on	the	Github.	The	Github	repository	holds	7 files,	including	an	INSTALL.txt	file, which	has	instructions	to	set	up	the	project.
